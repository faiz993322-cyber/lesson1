            <h2>Facts About Stars</h2>
            <p>
                Stars are giant, luminous balls of hot gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, that produce energy through nuclear fusion in their cores. The universe contains an estimated septillion stars, which are born in nebulae, go through life cycles, and eventually die. Stars appear to twinkle due to the Earth's atmosphere, not their own light, and are found in galaxies like our Milky Way, which contains billions of stars.
